Short documentation for the multiuser functionality:

The following configuration files and folders exist SYSTEMWIDE:

1. 

<LocalSigner Installation>/configuration/init.properties

This property file specifies default values for the configuration. It should ONLY be edited by administrators / e.g. root users. 
Make sure, that a normal user does not have write access to this file

The value: profilepath specifies the folder where the systemwide configuration is stored!

The values: XXXEditable specify if a normal user can change the particular option or not. (If true, 
the option can be changed in the configuration GUI of the application later) 


2.

<LocalSigner Installation>/resources/profiles

This folder contains the systemwide signature profiles which are available to all users. (The path to this folder is configured in the 
init.properties - see above point 1).

There are some profiles shipped with the application. Additional profiles can be created and must be stored in this folder to make
them available systemwide. Profiles can be created either by copy/paste/edit of an existing profile or by creating a signature profile
with the LocalSigner application itself, store it in the user profile folder (see below) and copy it afterwards into the systemwide
profile folder (Admin rights needed).


The following configuration files and folders exist PER USER:

When the application is started, the following folders and files are created IN THE USERS HOMEDIRECTROY if they do not exist yet:

<user home>/.localsigner

<user home>/.localsigner/userconfiguration.properties

<user home>/.localsigner/profiles 

The userconfiguration.properties file stores the localsigner configuration for the current user. All changes done inside the config
GUI inside the application is stored in this file. 
It is NOT recommended to edit it manually!
At start up, the configuration values of the system wide configuration are taken as default, except the path to the profiles!

In the profiles folder, the users signature profiles are stored. This folder can be changed in the GUI config.
