# Translation Instructions:
# -------------------------
# Java uses ISO 8859-1 as encoding for property files.
# Java cannot handle UTF-8 encoded property files!
# All non-Ascii characters must be escaped with \u.
#
# Do NOT translate the part before the first colon (:). The key must be in english.
# Special characters (must be escaped):
# \n line break
# \\ back slash
#
# Do not change values in form {0}, these placeholders are replaced dynamically.
#
# We recommend using Propedit (http://propedit.sourceforge.jp/index_en.html).
# This editor saves all non-Ascii characters in the correct escaped encoding.
#
# You can add a new language by writing a new language property file.

TSAErrorLong = Not able to reach a time stamp service.\n\nCheck your time stamp and proxy configuration.\nYou may alternatively sign without an external time stamp. But the recipient may require an external time stamp.\n\nDo you want to sign the document without any external time stamp?

TSAErrorShort = Error with TSA signature

TSAWarning = The date configured on your computer {0} is not the same as returned by the time stamp server {1}.\n\nCheck the time, date, and time zone configuration on your computer.\nThis date mismatch may be caused by the configured time zone.
